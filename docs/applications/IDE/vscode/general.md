# Method #1 – VS Code on Host, Toolchain in Dedicated Box, Debug via Attach-Inspect (Recommended)

* 📌 Recommended approach (with Sandboxie)
  The best setup is to run Cursor or VS Code normally on the host while executing all relevant subprocesses inside their own dedicated box. This includes, for example:

* the Electron binary inside the PNPM directory

* terminals used for PowerShell and CMD

* Node executables

This isolates the entire toolchain while keeping full functionality. Debugging via Attached Inspect continues to work. From a structural and security perspective, this is the strongest setup achievable with Sandboxie.

---

## Method #2 (Not Fully Isolated)

There is, of course, a second method — but it is not fully isolated because security isolation must be disabled. Once that protection is removed, the actual security value largely disappears. What remains is essentially rights virtualization and a few operational side effects, but no meaningful security gain.

---

## Conclusion

From a weighted architectural perspective, it is better to run VS Code normally on the host system and consistently isolate everything related to the toolchain — or launched from it — inside a dedicated box.

## Limitation — IDE Debug Script in `package.json` Does Not Work

A significant limitation is the classic IDE debug script behavior:
When you are inside a `package.json`, hover over a Run Script, and click “Debug Script.”

Complete documentation can be found in the referenced files.

This appears to be the only feature that does not work under this setup.

# Method #2 – Not Fully Isolated

## Not Working

* General Options → Restrictions → “Prevent interference with the user interface”

  * Do not enable

* Security Options → Security Isolation → “Disable security isolation”

  * Do not enable

Extensive testing shows that the setup generally does not function properly with security isolation enabled.

## Why Method #1 (Host VS Code) Scores Higher Than Method #2 (VS Code in Box Without Security Isolation)

**Core point:**
If you must disable “Security Isolation” for Cursor/VS Code, then the box is no longer a reliable security boundary. The benefit shifts from actual security to virtualization/operability — and in that domain, Option B introduces more side effects than measurable security improvements.

---

## 1) What You Actually Gain in Option B (And What You Don’t)

### Real (but limited) gains:

* **State containment / reset:** Writes remain inside the box → you can delete or roll back the box.
* Some UI-related restrictions (e.g., window covering, screen capture blocking) may still apply.

### What you do *not* gain (this is decisive):

* No real protection against data exfiltration from workspace content, tokens, API keys, browser sessions, etc., as long as Cursor has access to repositories and secrets.
* No clear trust boundary against RCE in extensions or workspace code if isolation/filtering is disabled.

**Result:**
The security score does not increase proportionally — even though it “looks boxed.”

---

## 2) Why Option B Is Often Architecturally Worse Than Host VS Code

### 2.1 False Sense of Security (Enterprise Red Flag)

A system that appears boxed but has its essential protection mechanisms disabled is operationally more dangerous than a clearly defined host setup.

Teams may implicitly trust it more (“it’s inside a box”), leading to riskier decisions:

* secrets stored directly in the workspace
* more extensions installed
* reduced scrutiny

This failure mode is common in enterprise security environments.

---

### 2.2 Increased Attack Surface and Complexity Without a Real Boundary

Running Cursor inside a box (without isolation) introduces:

* additional interoperability paths (clipboard, shell integration, file pickers, protocol handlers)
* more configuration-sensitive components (tasks, debug, terminal, IPC)
* greater drift potential (one changed setting alters behavior)

If the security gain is not substantial, this added complexity is architecturally negative.

---

### 2.3 Debug and Development Operability Become More Fragile

In practice:

* Debugging mechanisms depend on IPC and namespace details (named pipes / js-debug).
* Running Cursor inside any form of box increases the number of points where these mechanisms can fail — without providing a strong boundary.

Option A is structurally more stable:
The editor remains on the host, risky execution remains strictly isolated, debugging works via TCP attach.

---

## 3) Why Option A Is Cleaner in This Model

Option A follows a clear architecture:

* **Host:** Editor/UI (Cursor/VS Code) = trusted control plane
* **Box:** Node/Electron/Test runner = untrusted execution plane (hard isolated)
* **Bridge:** Attach-Inspect via TCP (5858/9222) = auditable and reproducible

This separation (Control Plane vs. Execution Plane) is common in enterprise architectures.

---

## 4) When Option B Still Makes Sense

Option B can make sense if the primary goal is reset/virtualization, for example:

* minimizing host writes from Cursor
* maintaining a clean slate between sessions
* explicitly accepting that it is not a real security boundary

In that case, it is an operability/hygiene feature — not a security upgrade.

---

## 5) Direct Answers

* **Why does Host VS Code score higher?**
  Because Option A establishes a clear, stable trust boundary where it matters (execution: Node/Electron) and avoids pseudo-security around the editor.

* **Isn’t it better to run VS Code inside a box?**
  Only if the goal is state reset or write virtualization — and with the understanding that this does not provide real isolation.

* **Why prefer Host proportionally?**
  Because disabling isolation in Option B adds complexity and interop surface without significantly improving the security boundary — while making debugging and development more fragile.

If needed, a measurable “Option B as hygiene/reset” configuration can be outlined next — including which box options still make sense and how to avoid the illusion of security.
